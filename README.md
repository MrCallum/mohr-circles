## What are Moh circles?
Manfred Mohr is New York based, German born digital artist. I found [this](http://www.emohr.com/sc69-73/vfile_48.html) and tried to make my own version. This work doesn't seem to have a title, so I've called these 'Mohr Circles'.
From some brief text on that page, and by observing Mohr's examples, the inner line has four rules:

- A line should be made up of 6 connected smaller lines.
- Lines should connect at multiples of 45 degrees.
- The next line may not double back on the last.
- Lines can be any length that fit inside the circle (my implementation does not obey this rule. Instead, lines are fixed in length).

coming soon.

## Motivation
I made this for some practice in:
- TDD (see test/test.js)
- React Redux (see src/store/reducer etc.)
- General mathsie practice / problem solving practice
